## Search Bar Memes

1.	Debouncing: Implements setTimeout to optimize API calls by delaying execution until user input has stopped.
2.	Lazy Loading: Uses React.lazy and Suspense for on-demand component loading.
3.	Memoization: Employs React.memo and useMemo to prevent unnecessary re-renders and enhance performance.
4.  Caching and Throttling: Caching stores previous results for faster access, while throttling limits API calls during typing, ensuring a smooth and efficient search process.
